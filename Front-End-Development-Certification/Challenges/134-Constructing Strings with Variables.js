//Constructing Strings with Variables: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/Constructing-Strings-with-Variables

//Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building. Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings "My name is " and " and I am swell!"


// Example
var ourName = "Free Code Camp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Edo";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am swell!";
