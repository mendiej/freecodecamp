//Comparison with the Inequality Operator: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/Comparison-with-the-Inequality-Operator

//The inequality operator (!=) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means "Not Equal" and returns false where equality would return true and vice versa. Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing. Examples Add the inequality operator != in the if statement so that the function will return "Not Equal" when val is not equivalent to 99


// Setup
function testNotEqual(val) {
  if (val!=99) { // Change this line
 Â   return "Not Equal";
  }
  return "Equal";
}

// Change this value to test
testNotEqual(10);
