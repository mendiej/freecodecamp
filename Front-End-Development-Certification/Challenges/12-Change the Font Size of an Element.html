<!-- Change the Font Size of an Element: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/Change-the-Font-Size-of-an-Element

Font size is controlled by the font-size CSS property, like this: Create a second p element after the existing p element with the following kitty ipsum text: Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched. Inside the same <style> tag that contains your red-text class, create an entry for p elements and set the font-size to 16 pixels (16px). NoteDue to browser implementation differences, you may need to be at 100% zoom to pass the tests on this challenge. Also, please do not add a class attribute to your new p element. -->

  .red-text {
