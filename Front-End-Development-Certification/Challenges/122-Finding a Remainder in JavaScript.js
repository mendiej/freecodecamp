//The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers. Example UsageIn mathematics, a number can be checked even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2. NoteThe remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as  the "modulus" operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers. Set remainder equal to the remainder of 11 divided by 3 using the remainder (%) operator.


// Only change code below this line

var remainder;
remainder = 11 % 3;
