//Accessing Objects Properties with the Dot Operator: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/Accessing-Objects-Properties-with-the-Dot-Operator

//There are two ways to access the properties of an object: the dot operator (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array. The dot operator is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time. Here is a sample of using the dot operator (.) to read an object property: Read in the property values of testObj using dot notation. Set the variable hatValue equal to the object property hat and set the variable shirtValue equal to the object property shirt.


// Setup
var testObj = {
  "hat": "ballcap",
  "shirt": "jersey",
  "shoes": "cleats"
};

// Only change code below this line

var hatValue = testObj.hat;      // Change this line
var shirtValue = testObj.shirt;    // Change this line
