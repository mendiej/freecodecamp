<!-- Use a CSS Class to Style an Element: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/Use-a-CSS-Class-to-Style-an-Element

Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements. Here's an example CSS class declaration: You can see that we've created a CSS class called blue-text within the <style> tag. You can apply a class to an HTML element like this: <h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2> Note that in your CSS style element, classes should start with a period. In your HTML elements' class declarations, classes shouldn't start with a period. Inside your style element, change the h2 selector to .red-text and update the color's value from blue to red. Give your h2 element the class attribute with a value of 'red-text'. -->


<style>
  .red-text {
 Â   color: red;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
