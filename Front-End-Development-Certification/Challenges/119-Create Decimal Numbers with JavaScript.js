//We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats. NoteNot all real numbers can accurately be represented in floating point. This can lead to rounding errors. Details Here. Create a variable myDecimal and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. 5.7).


var ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line
var myDecimal = 1.2;
