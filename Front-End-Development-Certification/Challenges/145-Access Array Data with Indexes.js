//Access Array Data with Indexes: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/Access-Array-Data-with-Indexes

//We can access the data inside arrays using indexes. Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array. Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array is element 0. Example Create a variable called myData and set it to equal the first value of myArray using bracket notation.


// Example
var ourArray = [1,2,3];
var ourData = ourArray[0]; // equals 1

// Setup
var myArray = [1,2,3];

// Only change code below this line.
myData = myArray[0]
