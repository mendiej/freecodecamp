<!-- Import a Google Font: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/Import-a-Google-Font

Now, let's import and apply a Google font (note that if Google is blocked in your country, you will need to skip this challenge). First, you'll need to make a call to Google to grab the Lobster font and load it into your HTML. Copy the following code snippet and paste it into the top of your code editor: <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"> Now you can set Lobster as a font-family value on your h2 element. Apply the font-family of Lobster to your h2 element. -->

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }
  
  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster;
  }
</style>
