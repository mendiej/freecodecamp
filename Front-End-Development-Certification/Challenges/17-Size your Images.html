<!-- Size your Images: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/Size-your-Images

CSS has a property called width that controls an element's width. Just like with fonts, we'll use px (pixels) to specify the image's width. For example, if we wanted to create a CSS class called larger-image that gave HTML elements a width of 500 pixels, we'd use: Create a class called smaller-image and use it to resize the image so that it's only 100 pixels wide. NoteDue to browser implementation differences, you may need to be at 100% zoom to pass the tests on this challenge. -->
